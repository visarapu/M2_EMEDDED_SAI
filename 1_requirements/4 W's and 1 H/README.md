# 4 W's an 1 H


## What

- we have made a setup based on a microcontroller in which real time distance is sensed by an ultrasonic sensor and displays measured distance on an LCD display.

## Where

- It measures accurate distance using a non-contact technology - A technology that involves no physical contact between sensor and object.

## When

- In 1959, Satomura created an ultrasonic flowmeter that used doppler technology.

## Why

- I am Developing this project for easily measure the distance between objects

## How

- By using Atmega328 an display an ultrasonic sensor mainly used to determine the distance of the target object.
