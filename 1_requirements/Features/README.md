# Features

## Hardware Features

- ATmega328 is commonly used in many projects and autonomous systems where a simple, low-powered, low-cost micro-controller is needed.
- A sound sensor is defined as a module that detects sound waves through its intensity and converting it to electrical signals.
- A display device is an output device for presentation of information in visual or tactile form.

## Software Features

- SimulIDE tool provides ATmega, AVR, Arduino and PIC microcontrollers that can be accessed just like other components. Features like gpsim and simavr allow you to use PIC and AVR microcontrollers, respectively.
- An automatic voltage regulator (AVR) is an electronic device that maintains a constant voltage level to electrical equipment on the same load. The AVR regulates voltage variations to deliver constant, reliable power supply.
